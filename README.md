# Find the Largest Rectangle
Generate 10 rectangles and populate with random sizes. Static declaration of rectangles will not be
accepted. It is expected that with each execution the rectangle values should be different.
Write an algorithm to find the largest rectangle. In case there is more than 1 rectangle with the same
size, the algorithm should find the rectangle with the largest height.
